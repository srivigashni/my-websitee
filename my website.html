    <h2 class="heading">Life style of indian army</h2>
    <p> Every minute of a soldier's life is strictly regulated and these bugle calls summon or prepare jawans for various activities, even rest.
     A bugle call is a simple but effective signal to commence or terminate activities in a unit line. The officers' mess is like a club with restricted entry for members only.
</p>
    <h1> 1.Teamwork</h1>
    <p>There could be no better example of teamwork than the military. Teamwork is a building block to a successful life. It is the collaborative effort of all the team members to achieve a common goal in the most effective and efficient way. This brings us to our next lesson.

 <h1>2. Discipline</h1>
 <p> While military might not be a 5-star place to live in, but surely produces 5-star officers. A disciplined environment and a disciplined organization are what produces a disciplined person. Personal discipline could start from personal grooming to dressing up to work ethics. A disciplined life develops attention to detail.</p>

 <h1>3.Know each member of the team inside out</h1>
 <p>This is the most important part of being on a team. If you are a leader, it is necessary for you to know each and every person on the team on a personal level thoroughly. It also becomes necessary for a team leader to know their team’s strengths and weaknesses so that he can make the effective use of his team.
</p>
<h1>4.Working under stress</h1>
<p>The whole process of SSB has a part in it where the assessor puts a candidate under stress. The point of this is that in the military, a person has to undertake tremendous pressure – both mentally and pushing limits physically. A non-military person living under such stress would not be able to cope with it unless he embraces the challenge and owns it.
</p>

<h1>5.Documenting everything</h1>
<p>Military is a government service and obviously, it has to maintain records. But when you are in the military, documentation is a part of life. Be it your own personal diary writing habit or keeping a record of your team’s visit. Documentation is surely a hectic task but it is best suited for jobs like this where a person has to move frequently to new places and leave a handbook for the successor to refer to.</p>

<h2 class="heading">Acadmics</h2>
<p>The National Defence Academy has the unique distinction of being the first joint training institution in the world that trains future officers of all the three Services in the spirit of jointmanship that proved so essential to success, in the battlefield, during the II World War. The founding fathers of NDA were seized of this significant idea and were given the mandate of establishing a National War Academy on the lines of USMA, WestPoint. The onus of transforming this idea into reality fell upon the Amarnath Jha Committee constituted in 1945 by the Govt. of India. On May 2, 1945, a press communiqué stated the task cut out for the committee. It was that of establishing a Military Academy for the education and basic training of all the future officers of the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian Army and the Royal Indian Air Force.  Moreover, it clearly spelt out the academic dimension thus “Education upto the University standard will be imparted at the Academy and will embrace a comprehensive course in such general subjects, History, Modern languages, Science and Engineering as well as in purely military subjects. Stress will be laid on the development of character, self-reliance, leadership and self-discipline which are essential qualities … for officers in the armed forces….”

    The Committee thus drew up a two-year course syllabus for the ISW in 1948, fixing the ratio of Academic subjects to Service subjects as 2:1. 
    A majority of Indian Universities recognized this syllabus as equivalent to Intermediate Science (FA – Freshman of Arts). 
 The emphasis the committee laid was not merely on qualifying for a degree  but on the holistic  development of the whole personality of the cadets defining its objective as that of producing cadets who at the end of their course of training would “have the requisite educational standard and shall have acquired the mental, moral and physical qualities essential to his progressive and continual development as an officer of the fighting force, together with any basic service training considered necessary” It is these salient points that became the seed and foundational principles by which all academic training at NDA has been guided till date.  
 Following this the syllabus saw several revisions, significantly, one by the Mahajani Committee in 1969 and another by the Committee for the Review of the Training of Officers of the three Services (CORTOS) in 1986. The aim was to update the training of cadets to keep pace with the ever-changing academic and military environment and the upsurge in information and communication technology. The present syllabus of NDA is the result of periodic reviews by two Committees, namely, the Inter-Services Study Group (ISSG) constituted by the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 2004, 2013 and 2017 as well as the Academic Study Groups (ASG) that were constituted along with each ISSG. Today in keeping with the changing military scenario of NDA offers a liberal arts degree as well as degrees in Science, Computer Science and B.Tech.
     All of which is well supplemented by training in Service subjects, rigorous physical and equestrian training as well as the impartation of moral and leadership qualities that is the essence of soldiering.</p>
